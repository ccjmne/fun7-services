# fun7-services

A native (!) backend [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) server of Fun7's fictional services, written in [Java](https://openjdk.org/).

```

## Technologies

- [Quarkus](https://quarkus.io/) framework for development.
  - with [Jib](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib) for containerisation
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) for data management.
- [Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run) for [serverless](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serverless_computing) computing.
- [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) for [continuous integration](https://www.atlassian.com/continuous-delivery/continuous-integration).

## Play With It

1. Edit [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml) to tweak the [environment variables](#environment-variables)
   - notably, the `ADPARTNER_URL`
2. `docker-compose up --detach`
3. [Query it with your browser](http://localhost:8080?cc=SI&userId=123456789012345678901234&timezone=Europe/Ljubljana)
   - by default, you can access the user administration with `admin`:`pwd`.
4. `docker-compose down`

OR

- Query the [Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run) endpoint where it is (temporarily) hosted:  
  [https://fun7-jsppj7p4zq-od.a.run.app](https://fun7-jsppj7p4zq-od.a.run.app/?cc=SI&userId=123456789012345678901234&timezone=Europe/Ljubljana)
  - you'll likely experience some ~0.040s delay (40ms üò±) the first time, because Cloud Run needs to start up the server :)
  - this endpoint actually queries Fun7's ad partner

|                           |                                                                                               |

|                           |                                                                                               |
| `ADMIN_PASSWORD`          | The password for the `admin` account that can access `/users`<br />e.g.: `pwd`                |

### Implementation Details

- A user in the database has 3 properties:

  - `id`: their unique identifier
  - `country`: the code of the country they last "checked in" from
  - `apiCalls`: the number of times they "checked in"

- A user therefore looks like this:

```json
{
  "id": "12345678901234567890abcd",
  "country": "SI",
  "apiCalls": 22
}
```

- The `timezone` query parameter supplied by the user is discarded and serves no purpose

  - `// TODO:` maybe at least store it in the database?

- Users are created/updated in the database ever time they (succesfully) query `GET /`

- The `/users` endpoint isn't publicly accessible and requires authentication

  - by default, set up w/ [basic authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication) against an [embedded](https://quarkus.io/guides/security-properties#embedded-realm-configuration) security realm

- I removed the "publish to Google Cloud Registry" part of the CI workflows and only publish to GitHub Container Registry

  - Note to self

  ```shell script
  docker pull ghcr.io/ccjmne/fun7-services-native
  docker tag ghcr.io/ccjmne/fun7-services-native gcr.io/fun7-357415/fun7-services-native:latest
  docker push gcr.io/fun7-357415/fun7-services-native:latest
  ```

- Integration testing isn't my _forte_

- The relevant configuration entries are mapped to environment variables that match `[A-Z_]+`
  - ... because Google Cloud's Kubernetes Engine doesn't accept `dotdash-style.environment-vars`
  - ... despite Kubernetes itself being fine with it. Maybe it's just GKE's Web interface that doesn't play nice.
    - actually, I can't set the minimum number of pods to be `0` either
    - ... despite Kubernetes allowing it
    - (I read in some GitHub issue that GKE also did, so maybe the culprit really is only their Web interface)

## Licensing

**GPL-3.0**

You may copy, distribute and modify the software as long as you track changes/dates in source files. Any modifications to or software including (via compiler) GPL-licensed code must also be made available under the GPL along with build & install instructions.

There is nothing more below but the useful parts of Quarkus' starter project's README.

## Running the application in dev mode

You can run your application in dev mode that enables live coding using:

```shell script
./mvnw compile quarkus:dev
```

## Packaging and running the application

The application can be packaged using:

```shell script
./mvnw package
```

It produces the `quarkus-run.jar` file in the `target/quarkus-app/` directory.
Be aware that it‚Äôs not an _√ºber-jar_ as the dependencies are copied into the `target/quarkus-app/lib/` directory.

The application is now runnable using `java -jar target/quarkus-app/quarkus-run.jar`.

If you want to build an _√ºber-jar_, execute the following command:

```shell script
./mvnw package -Dquarkus.package.type=uber-jar
```

The application, packaged as an _√ºber-jar_, is now runnable using `java -jar target/*-runner.jar`.

## Creating a native executable

You can create a native executable using:

```shell script
./mvnw package -Pnative
```

Or, if you don't have GraalVM installed, you can run the native executable build in a container using:

```shell script
./mvnw package -Pnative -Dquarkus.native.container-build=true
```

You can then execute your native executable with: `./target/fun7-services-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner`
